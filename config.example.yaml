porcupine:
  access_key: "YOUR_PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY"  # Free from https://console.picovoice.ai/
  
  # Option 1: Use built-in keywords (easier, works offline)
  # Available: "porcupine", "bumblebee", "terminator", "americano", "blueberry", etc.
  keywords:
    - "terminator"
  
  # Option 2: Use a custom wake word (requires training, better UX)
  # Steps:
  #   1. Go to https://console.picovoice.ai/ and create a custom keyword
  #   2. Train for your target platform (e.g., "Raspberry Pi (32-bit ARM)")
  #   3. Download the .ppn file
  #   4. Uncomment keyword_paths and set the path to your .ppn file
  # keyword_paths:
  #   - "/home/distiller/Projects/openclaw-voice-agent/models/hey-openclaw_en_raspberry-pi.ppn"
  
  # Sensitivity: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher = more sensitive, catches quieter speech)

  hw_channels: 2         # Hardware mic channels (PamirAI requires 2; set to 1 for USB mics)
  record_seconds: 5      # Max recording duration after wake word
  silence_threshold: 300  # RMS threshold for silence detection (lower = more sensitive)

# OpenClaw local gateway (runs on your machine)
# OpenClaw is a self-hosted Node.js gateway that connects to AI providers.
# It does NOT require an OpenClaw API key; instead it uses your AI provider credentials.
# See: https://docs.openclaw.ai
openclaw:
  base_url: "http://localhost:18789"  # Default OpenClaw Gateway port
  agent_id: "main"       # Agent to route messages to (default: "main")
  session_id: ""         # Optional: specific session ID (overrides agent_id)
                         # Get from: openclaw sessions --json
  timeout: 60            # Max seconds to wait for agent response

# Text-to-speech
